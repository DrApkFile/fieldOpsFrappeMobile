/**
 * Real, server-derived "which outlets has this agent visited today" — a sale or
 * order against an outlet today counts as a visit. This used to be a plain local
 * flag (MARK_OUTLET_VISITED / RESET_OUTLET_VISIT_STATUS on outlet.status) set only
 * on whichever device completed the action — meaning it never reflected reality
 * if the agent switched phones mid-day, and vanished on a reinstall. Sales and
 * orders already carry a real `outlet` id and date from the backend (confirmed
 * live), so "visited" is derived from that instead of trusted local-only state.
 *
 * Surveys can't be included yet — get_my_surveys doesn't return which outlet a
 * response belongs to (confirmed live: {"survey":"SRV-0001","status":"Submitted"},
 * no outlet field at all) — so a survey-only visit is currently invisible to this.
 * That's a backend gap, not something fixable from here.
